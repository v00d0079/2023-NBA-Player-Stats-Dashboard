Justification:
I think my project was a medium to high difficulty task overall, while the data was very easily cleaned and recorded well in its raw form there were other challenges based on graphing. Firstly while creating the top 50 graphs I had alot of difficulty with getting the graphs to reorder in descending order due to how the aes_string field of ggplot works so I had to create multiple graphs rather than just one with a changeable input. Secondly creating and modifying tooltips with ggplotly proved difficult since there werent many great ways to replace the named variable the tip pulled from. I also think while theres are alot of similar graphs still creating multiple graphs was relatively difficult especially when it came to deciding what factors should the user input. I think overall my project deserves a B+ for the effort I put into creating the application.
